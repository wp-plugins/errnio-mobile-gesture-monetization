= Features =

Our main features include enhancement of the following items:

* **Web Search** - a web search box is added to the top of the screen. An additional layer of content and recommended actions is added, labeled \"top hits\". This serves users with promoted actions and content helping you as a site owner, to earn revenue off exiting traffic in a seamless and unobtrusive way.
* **Text Selection** - enhanced with a simple addition of promoted actions like search, share or related content. Much like our search offers, these promoted actions enable you as a site owner to add incremental revenue to the site. 
* **Bottom bar** - in certain mobile browsers, an additional bottom bar is displayed, providing options of browsing related content, sharing, quick links to popular exit sites, and a new tab to continue browsing.

= How it Works =
The **errnio plugin** reaches out to errnio servers and injects the errnio **gesture recognition code**.
The gesture recognition code taps into your visitor gestures, performed on your site, and analyses which errnio monetization unit will work effectively - choosing among the several units detailed above. 
errnio works with various 3rd party advertisers by connecting the right offers to the right gesture in the right context in and the right time - **ONLY** and **EXCLUSIVELY** within the errnio gesture functions. We never inject ads into your site!

Using the unique **errnio** plugin maxmizes your full monetization potential on mobile web.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* **What is errnio?**
errnio adds gesture based monetization to the mobile view of your site, and enhances user engagement with additional mobile functionality.errnio allows you to enjoy added revenue for your mobile traffic while any other monetization units continue to work undisturbed.
* **What is the difference between errnio and other monetization units?**
Glad you asked, other then the fact that errnio is a new type of monetization relying on the user?s finger movements across you website, it also contains NO banners or popups!

Niet!
