errnio adds gesture based monetization tools to the mobile view of the site. Enhances mobile engagement with additional mobile functionality. 

== Description ==

The **Gesture Monetization** pack from errnio adds a new revenue and engagement layer to your site with a simple addition of a plugin. The plugin enables several gesture based tools to be added to any mobile browsing session. The tools act as enhancements to regular bowser elements, which enhance the experience of the user on a mobile device. 

Demo this on your site in seconds with our cool [simulator!](http://www.errnio.com/simulator/\"errnio simulator\")

Our main features include enhancement of the following items:
* **Web Search** ? a web search box is added to the top of the screen. An additional layer of content and recommended actions is added, labeled \"top hits\". This serves users with promoted actions and content helping you as a site owner, to earn revenue off exiting traffic in a seamless and unobtrusive way.
* **Text Selection** ? enhanced with a simple addition of promoted actions like search, share or related content. Much like our search offers, these promoted actions enable you as a site owner to add incremental revenue to the site. 
* **Bottom bar** ? in certain mobile browsers, an additional bottom bar is displayed, providing options of browsing related content, sharing, quick links to popular exit sites, and a new tab to continue browsing.

=How it Works=
The errnio plugin reaches out to errnio servers and injects the errnio gesture recognition code.
The gesture recognition code taps into your visitor gestures, performed on your site, and analyses which errnio monetization unit will work effectively - choosing among the several units detailed above. 
errnio works with various 3rd party advertisers by connecting the right offers to the right gesture in the right context in and the right time - ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY within the errnio gesture functions. We never inject ads into your site!

Using errnio unique plugin brings you the full potential of monetization in the mobile world.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* **What is errnio?**
errnio adds gesture based monetization to the mobile view of your site, and enhances user engagement with additional mobile functionality.errnio allows you to enjoy added revenue for your mobile traffic while any other monetization units continue to work undisturbed.
* **What is the difference between errnio and other monetization units?**
Glad you asked, other then the fact that errnio is a new type of monetization relying on the user?s finger movements across you website, it also contains NO banners or popups!
Most monetization products for mobile compete with each other for the same space they take on you site. **errnio** can live side by side with any banner (or display unit) and you can profit from two revenue streams rather then only one.
* **Does errnio run on desktop screens?**
Niet!

After you installed the plugin you should get a notification requesting your site-id.
Go to our site, errnio.com and register. Once you?ve done this, you?ll get a site-id which you can type in the options page of the plugin (follow the notification).
After everything is ready you can manage your plugin on the errnio dashboard and collect you revenues.
